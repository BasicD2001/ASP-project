# 🌲 Tree Manipulation Project - Algorithms and Data Structures

This is the **final project** for the **Algorithms and Data Structures** course (2023), developed in **C++**. The application allows full interaction with a dynamically constructed **tree** data structure, supporting a variety of operations such as node addition, deletion, and loading from a file.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to demonstrate the application of recursive structures and algorithms in managing hierarchical data (trees).

### ✅ Supported Features

- Add new nodes to the tree dynamically  
- Load tree structure from a formatted `.txt` file  
- Delete nodes (with or without subtrees)  
- Check for the existence of specific nodes  
- Track and visualize **recursive operations** in the tree  
- Print or traverse the tree using different traversal methods

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++** (standard libraries only)
- **Custom file parser** for importing tree structures
- Emphasis on **recursion** and **pointer-based tree construction**
